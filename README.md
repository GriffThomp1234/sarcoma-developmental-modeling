# Investigating Developmental Origins of Sarcomas

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Investigating Developmental Origins of Sarcomas** repository! This project outlines my contributions during my tenure at the **Shlien Lab at SickKids, Toronto**, where I utilized advanced computational techniques and machine learning models to analyze sarcoma transcriptional data. This study aimed to uncover the developmental origins of sarcomas, focusing on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing data.

The work involved developing and running computational pipelines, leveraging tools like R, OTTER, and UMAP to classify sarcoma subtypes and infer their developmental trajectories. Please note that the research code is proprietary as it is part of an unpublished study and, therefore, not included in this repository. This repository serves as a report on my contributions to the project.
